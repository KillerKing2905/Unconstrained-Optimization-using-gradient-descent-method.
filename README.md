Unconstrained Optimization Using Gradient Descent
This project demonstrates the implementation of the gradient descent method for solving unconstrained optimization problems. The project includes binary files for the code and a detailed report in a Word document.

Introduction
This project implements the gradient descent algorithm to solve unconstrained optimization problems. Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. In this project, we demonstrate how the method can be applied to various optimization problems, and provide a detailed report explaining the methodology, experiments, and results.
